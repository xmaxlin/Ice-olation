                    Our proposed final project will be to realistically render ice. Our aim is to trace light through our ice rendered objects and model how light scatters after passing through ice. If given enough time, we also plan to try modeling crack propagation within ice.

                    Problem Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our final project, we want to explore how to render ice. Ice might be used in a video game or movie to create natural landscapes or interactive objects, as it is found in a variety of different forms in the real world. What makes ice compelling to us as a material,
                    however, is its nuanced texture and its translucency. Ice forms through crystallization, and often has air bubbles and cracks trapped under its surface. The surface itself usually has imperfections as well, and is both bumpy and glossy due to the ice melting.
                    In part because of the structural properties of ice, when light shines on ice, it is refracted through it. Depending on how pure the ice is, it can appear more or less opaque, and can even appear to glow under a light source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we want to focus on the refraction of light through ice in our project, we will also be incorporating aspects of its texture. We expect modelling the texture of ice to be particularly challenging, as we have to account for different forms of ice, such ice that is
                    perfectly smooth and mostly transparent, ice that has cracks and air bubbles, or ice that is rough and opaque like an icicle. For crack propagation, we plan to model our code off of the algorithms found in the resources linked below. For light refraction and roughness,
                    we plan to experiment with these variable elements to produce different models of ice.

                    Goals and Deliverables
                </h2>

                <h4>
                    What we plan to deliver
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In this project, we plan to model the properties of ice close enough so that it behaves as realistically as possible when we shine light through it. Our vision is largely inspired by project 3 where we have objects in some space and we shine a light on this object. However, unlike project 3,
                    we want to shine light on ice and model how the light behaves when the rays travel through the ice. We were looking at cool effects that this can produce, especially when we put different colored lights inside the ice as well. Our idea on how we will measure our performance is on how closely 
                    the lighting effects that we model match up with reality. Realistic ice comes in many shapes, sizes, and density. Ice can have cracks or bubbles within them when they are formed, which make it even harder to model after. So as our baseline, we plan to first model "ideal" looking and shaped ice.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    What we hope to deliver
                </h4>
                <p>
                    If all goes well, we hope to deliver a pretty good model of how ice behaves when we (1) shine light on it and (2) place light inside it. If we have enough time after we finished our baseline project, then we want to try our hand at implementing either crack propagation or trapped air bubbles
                    to give the ice a more realistic look to it.
